		<h3>Q </h3><p class="question">What do you guys do?</p>
<h3>A </h3><p class="answer">Whenever there is a decent swell, people out paddling around, or the sun is shining, we are out taking pictures along the beach. If we get some good shots of you, we'll give you a card with a unique "session code" that can be registered on our website to view the photos we took of you. <br />
