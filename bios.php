				<div class="biotext">
					<p>Zack Kersh was born in Laguna Niguel, California April 18th, 1991. Being born in the Mecca of skim boarding, surfing, and body boarding, Zack excelled in these water sports. Zack was apart of Dana Hills High's surfing, baseball, football, and wrestling teams. He happened to be the ASB President of Dana Hills his senior year in high school. In his younger years, Zack was a bleach-blonde surf rat, the rhythm guitarist in a rock band, a piano and violin player. In addition, Zack embarked on a 5-year journey to obtain his black belt in Korean Tai-Kwon-Do. After this venture, he moved on to Brazilian jiu-jitsu where he fought and represented Gracie Barra. During Zack's jiu-jitsu career, he was sponsored by Live for MMA and WearPhoenix.</p>
					<br />
					<p> Zack has spent the majority of his life traveling and doing various sports and activities. When Zack was 7-years old, he lived in Bali, Indonesia for a month where he simply surfed and played. Zack has traveled all throughout Europe and visited: England, France, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Most recently, Zack recently returned home from a 6-month study abroad in Sydney, Australia. When Zack wasn't studying at the University of New South Wales, he was surfing Bondi Beach, Tamarama, Bronte, and Maroubra.</p><br />
					<p> While living in Australia, Zack became scuba certified and traveled to Cairns, Australia. While in Cairns, Zack went scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef and went sky-diving. It is here where Zack thought of the basic principles of Shoreline Shots. He then spent time in South Australia where he visited Melbourne. After Australia, Zack spent time in New Zealand where he went bungee jumping, jet boating, white-water rafting, and glacier hiking.</p>
					<br />
					<p>If it sounds like Zack does it all, it's because he does. In his free time, Zack rock climbs, surfs and goes spear fishing. During the winter, Zack loves to snowboard and frequently visits various Colorado mountains and Mammoth to challenge himself. Zack thoroughly enjoys Isla Vista's caf√© culture and photography scene. He also started a DJ and Audio Engineer company called Kershendo. While Zack is the founder of Shoreline Shots and Kershendo, he also is endeavoring to achieve a degree in Political Science and minor in English. Yeah, this kid can do it all.</p>
