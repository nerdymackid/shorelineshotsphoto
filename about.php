	<p>Shoreline Shots is a photography service for the average surfer. We are founded on the idea that your average surfer may not have the time, knowledge, money, or experience to warrant hiring a personal photographer. We operate on the principle that if you're ripping or having a good time, you're worthy of getting professionally photographed. If we got some great shots of you, we'll tell you when you come in. Later you can go online, check yourself out, and download any photographs you think are sick!</p><br />

	
	<p>On top of photographing surfers, Shoreline Shots is a personalized, local surf report. Monday through Friday around 8 am, we are down checking the surf and taking photographs. We post daily surf reports on our website, twitter, and through an email subscription. Our daily reports include descriptions of the surf as well as a couple of photos of the conditions. These photos are all available to purchase as prints.	
	</p>	<br />
	<p> Shoreline Shots is all about giving back. As we view ourselves as a group that promotes surf to the masses, 25% of our profits are directed to groups that help underprivileged people get in the lineup.
	</p><p><br />
	Although we are principally a surf photography company, we would be interested in expanding our services to other great sports such as skating, snowboarding, skiing, racing, or rock climbing.
